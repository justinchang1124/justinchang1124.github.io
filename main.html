            <h2>What is the MOAA?</h2>
            <p>
              The Math Open At Andover is an annual mathematics competition for middle school teams, hosted by
              Phillips Academy Andover in Andover, Massachusetts. At MOAA, middle school students can experience
              mathematical exploration, collaboration, and competition. We hope to promote the involvement of
              middle school students in the mathematical community with a fulfilling, intellectually stimulating,
              and fun experience for everybody.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problems and formatting of MOAA are inspired by the most memorable competition questions that we
              have encountered in our own journeys through competition mathematics. Attending the MOAA competition
              is more than a standalone event - it is also designed to prepare students for other high school contests
              and give them a valuable taste of the mathematics that may await them in the future. As the organizers
              of the MOAA, we are passionate mathematicians and we would love to show you a good time at
              Phillips Academy Andover!
            </p>
            <h2>Who can attend?</h2>
            <p>
              Students can attend if they are in 8th Grade or below. Schools may register as many teams as they wish,
              each with at most 6 students. Individual participants are also more than welcome to register. We recommend
              4 to 6 members per team, so individuals and teams with less than 4 students may be combined for certain
              rounds of the competition.
            </p>
            <h2>How can I practice?</h2>
            <p>
              Keep scrolling for practice sets! They will be released by July 1st, 2018.

            <h2>Format</h2>
            <p>
              The competition will consist of three rounds. The problems on each round can be solved using only middle school 
              mathematical techniques and every problem is computationally feasible without calculators. Unless explicitly stated 
              otherwise, the use of any external source or aid, including calculators, dictionaries, notes, coaches, or proctors, 
              is prohibited.
            </p>
            <h3>Individual Round</h3>
            <p>
             Each participant will take this test individually. Participants will have 50 minutes to complete the 20 question test. 
             All answers are non-negative integers and no answer will have a value greater than 1,000,000. 
            </p>
            <h3>Team Round</h3>
            <p>
                This test will be given to teams of up to 6 participants. Team members may freely collaborate with the members of 
                their team, but not the members of any other team, to solve the 10 questions of the test in the allotted time limit 
                of 50 minutes. All answers are non-negative integers and no answer will have a value greater than 1,000,000. 
            </p>
            <h3>Gunga Bowl</h3>
            <p>
              The precise format of this round has not yet been released. It is intended for teams and permits free collaboration 
              among team members.  All answers are non-negative integers.

            <h2>Rules and Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Please respect and obey the following guidelines; doing so will make the contest experience better for everyone!</p>
            <h3>In-Competition Rules</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                No electronic devices or calculation aids (including calculators, phones, or calculator watches) are permitted on 
                any portion of the MOAA unless explicitly authorized by the MOAA team. Basic watches are not exempt from this rule; 
                the time will be provided at regular intervals. Medical devices are exempt from this rule if the MOAA team is informed 
                of the situation, in writing, by 11:59 PM EST on October 4th, 2018. 
              </li>
              <li>
                No mathematical texts or notes of any kind are permitted. Rely on your brain!
              </li>
              <li>
                Compasses, protractors, rulers, straightedges, graph paper, blank scratch paper, and writing implements 
                are generally permitted, so long as they are not designed to give an unfair advantage.
              </li>
              <li>
                All answers for any question on any round will be non-negative integers between 0 and 1,000,000, inclusive.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the Individual Round, giving or receiving help from any other individual - such as a teammate, a parent, or a coach 
                - will result in disqualification. On all other rounds, individuals may only help or receive help from members of their 
                team - consulting any other individual is grounds for disqualification. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Proctors may not answer any questions about the contest problems until the conclusion of the MOAA. As such, we will 
                not be able to explain any of the mathematical terminology on the MOAA to individuals or teams until the conclusion 
                of the contest. 
              </li>
              <li>
                If you believe that the test contains a mathematical error or that a demonstrable error has occurred during the 
                scoring process, please email a comprehensive written appeal to a Tournament Director or Program Coordinator before 
                11:59 PM on October 7th, 2018. Late appeals cannot be processed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any questions or requests for clarification regarding the above should be forwarded to the Tournament Directors on the
                "Contact Us" page. Decisions made by the MOAA team are final and may not be appealed.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Integrity is of the utmost importance in any competitive event. Any individual or team discovered to be providing or 
                receiving unauthorized aid by any means on any portion of the competition will be penalized at the discretion of the
                MOAA team and Phillips Academy Public Safety.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any individual that interferes with or jeopardizes the fairness of the competition - including the grading and 
                awarding process - may be disqualified. Any other participants affiliated with the individuals, such as their 
                teammates, may also be disqualified.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any individual that jeopardizes the physical or mental wellness of anyone else at the competition may be removed from 
                the competition at the discretion of the MOAA team and Phillips Academy Public Safety. 
              </li>
              <li>
                We cannot be responsible for any contest-day contingencies that prevent an individual or team from competing at 
                full capacity. All proposed accommodations must be explicitly communicated to the MOAA team, in writing, 
                by 11:59 PM EST on October 4th, 2018.
